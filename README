This fork is for optimizing running on an embedded device such as Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone Black.
It's focus is more geared towards a standalone spaceship simulator than for it original purpose as a multi-player game.

smcameron was very generous in creating quick-start functionality that allowed more seamless operation as a simulator. The project has since progressed far beyond the ability for any embedded device to run it smoothly.

The starting point of this fork will be the closest commit around the time the quick start functionality was added (about 9 months prior of the start of this fork) as that was the last point I know of that performance was acceptable. 

Thanks again to smcameron for space-nerds-in-space.
